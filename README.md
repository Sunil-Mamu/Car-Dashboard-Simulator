# Car-Dashboard-Simulator
Build a basic Android app simulating a vehicle infotainment dashboard. It includes:  Speedometer (dummy speed value that updates)  Music player UI mock (play/pause, next, previous buttons)  Navigation card with current "destination"  Button to toggle between Day/Night UI themes (to simulate infotainment styling)
# 🚗 Car Dashboard Simulator

A simple Android app built with Kotlin that simulates a basic car infotainment Human-Machine Interface (HMI). This project mimics elements of an in-vehicle system including a speedometer, music player UI, and navigation card — designed as a demonstration of Android UI development and reactive programming with ViewModel and LiveData.

## 📱 Features

- ⏩ **Speedometer Simulation**  
  Displays a live-updating vehicle speed using Kotlin `LiveData`.

- 🎵 **Music Player UI (Mock)**  
  Basic playback controls (Play, Pause, Next, Previous) with mock song titles.

- 🧭 **Navigation Card**  
  Displays a placeholder destination like “Home” or “Work.”

- 🌗 **Day/Night Mode Toggle**  
  Switch between light and dark themes to simulate real infotainment systems.
